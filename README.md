```
I wanna change the world but
I can't cause I'm damn weak
All I can do is just to think of
it
I wanna change the world but
I can't cause I'm damn weak
What a shame but I have to face
it
I am Grasshopper
My life is Dangerous
Hard every day
Cats want to eat me
Birds are also loving me
Even the other insects try to
catch me
for their meal
The other day,my friend was
eaten by
them.Just in front of me.
I really wanted to help him But
I could't.
I runaway for fear.
Afterwords I felt so sorrowful.
How coward I am !!
However hard I try
Our life are too short
When I ride the prairie
with spreading my wings
I feel so alive I feel I can do
everything in this world
However hard I try
Our life are too short
When I ride the prairie
with spreading my wings
However hard I try
Our life are too short
When I ride the prairie
with spreading my wings
I wanna change the world but
I can't cause I'm damn weak
All I can do is just to think of
it
I wanna change the world but
I can't cause I'm damn weak
What a shame but I have to face
it
